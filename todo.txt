# Biomes
* Plateau biomes?
* Bayou
* Everglades
* Steppe -> something unique
* Forest with balloon-y trees (see misc entry)
* Kauri forest
* Mixed forest
* Lake biomes
* Different beach types
* Inland oceans
* Coastal biome variants
* Sequoia forest
* Rice Field
* Gravelly desert
* Rocky desert
* Stone Spires (basically the ending fight area of Avatar lmao)
* Cherry forest
* Floodplains
* Everest biome, somehow

# Blocks and items
* More flower types
* Aquatic plants
* Implement curly grass
* Sap block
* Sap mob trap
* Acorns -> grow large trees
* Birch seeds -> grow large birch trees
* Turpentine in sap distillery

# Misc
* Stop procrastinating on cold biomes
* Balloon-y tree with edges hanging off (this is very hard to describe in text)
* Take another look at well carvers
* Variants for the newly added biomes
* Fallen logs for every biome
* Add edge biomes to everything
* Burned village for dead spruce forests
* Improve the look of a few biomes (remove shrubs, more unique features, etc.)
* Add fruit tags
* Add Avocado, name advancement "6.02e23"

# Improved terrain
* Change shrubs to grow more frequently in medium quality areas
* Change shrubs to grow shorter when under trees
* Trees create podzol, maybe?
* Surrounding chunks influence chunk data
* Possion Disk Sampling
* look into Adaptive Incremental Stippling (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/ab10b9)
* Improve branching algorithm (cellular automata? L-systems?)
* Different tree species
* Fruit trees
* Leaf generation variations
* Abstract out tree gen
* Special tree generation items (acorn, birch seed)
* Trees don't set block to dirt
* Fix disks
* Skip analysis when good soil quality
* Aquifers

* Add flowers to bonemeal
* More clover variation

# Automation
* Testing suite to find errors within biomes (no strongholds, etc.)

# Fruit trees thoughts and design
* Seperate leaves, normal wood (for simplicity)
* Controlled by a blockentity underneath the tree, like dynamic trees
* Fruit leaves will have multiple stages, and will always be in a state of flux
  * Empty->Flowering->Fruit
  * Fruiting leaves can drop their fruit on the ground like in DF, and they will return back to empty
  * The BE will ensure that once the tree is fully grown, the ratio of fruit to flowering to empty leaves is fairly consistent
* Dropped fruits can be picked up to yield fruits or mulch
